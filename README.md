# RankSync
This plugin has been made to give people an easy option to synchronize
ranks between Minecraft and Discord. This simplifies for example purging staffmembers,
giving donators their ranks on Discord.

Please note that the ranks will be given on Discord, based on the Minecraft ranks, 
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. People will only get their rank on Discord when the ranks
they have are included in the config.yml.
